# Ticketing Web Application

I developed a ticketing application using Laravel and Bootstrap. Utilizing Laravel's built-in features and libraries, I implemented various functionalities, including user authentication, ticket submission, image upload, profile management, and admin feedback. Additionally, I added extra features such as chart generation and image search using the Unsplash API. Working independently, I designed and implemented the application from start to finish, ensuring a seamless and efficient ticketing system. By leveraging Laravel's capabilities and incorporating additional functionalities, I created a fully functional ticketing application that provided an enhanced user experience.
